# Local Business and Customer habilitation

A website that hosts local businesses

On the landing page, we will have 2 options:

- Login as a customer (Support local businesses)
- Login as a business owner (Add your store here)

**Flow for login as a business owner:**

- Logs in/registers on our platform
- Upon registering, he/she is shown a page that asks for basic info about his business
  - That info will include:
    - Location
    - Name of shop
    - The domain of items for sale.
- Upon login, he/she will be shown a dashboard where he can see the orders(enquiries) that have been placed with him.
- He can choose to reject an offer or he can accept it (Figure out flow later)

**Flow for login as a customer:**

- After logging in, he/she will be shown a list of local stores ONLY IN HIS LOCATION. He can filter the stores based on domains and he can also change the location but default location will be the one he gives us in his login info
- He can then enquire about a particular order. If the business owner accepts, the order will be placed (Figure flow out later)
